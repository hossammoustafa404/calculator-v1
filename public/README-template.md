### What I learned

I had implemented stack data structure and use it in my project to get the result of math expression.

### Continued development

I have faced some problems with colors, styled-components,logic of get the result of the math expression (so you can fin some bugs in the app) and how to organize my project files, so in the future i want to learn more about those.
